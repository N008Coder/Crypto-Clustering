# Crypto-Clustering
Using Unsupervised machine learning to cluster different Crypto currencies based on percentage change over the last 24 hours, week, 2 weeks, month, 2months, 200 days and year
  Utilize the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and then graph out the clusters
  Use the PCA technique to narrow down the scope of the machine learning and then apply the same Elbow method to determine number of clusters and then lastly, visualize the clusters once the model has been created, fitted, and trained
